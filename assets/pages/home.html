            <h2>Humble Beginnings</h2>
            <span>
                Geesecraft is a Minecraft SMP hosted by iiPython yearly as part of summer break. It began with only 2 members (DmmD and iiPython) living off in a wooden shack around May of 2021, and it has grown into a welcoming community for relaxing and socializing since then.

            <h2>Freedom for All</h2>
            <span>
                What are the rules of Geesecraft? Simple, there are none!* Geesecraft is a you-do-you type server where members aren't required to do anything they don't want to. If you want to bomb somebody's house, go for it (although do expect to be bombed back).
            </span>
            <span>
                *: There might be restrictions in regard to cheating, hacking, or intentionally crashing the server with lag machines. We will let you know if it is acceptable or disruptive. Also, while there are no official rules, please at least have some common sense in the most basic human etiquette. If someone tells you to stop, you probably should! Thank you!

            <h2>Automation First</h2>
            <span>
                Do you like technical Minecraft? You're in luck! This is an automation-centered server, and no matter what season you join, you will see automatic farms, game-breaking contraptions, and whatever else you could imagine. Since Season 4, we've also incorporated techology mods such as Applied Energistics 2 into the server, giving us even more power over the landscape.

            <span>
                Now that we are all busy in college, there isn't as much time to play Minecraft together as we once did anymore. However, I didn't want to give up this memory either. That's why I decided to start a new season dedicated specifically to our time in college!
